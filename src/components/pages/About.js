      <p>
        Hi there! I have a background in Chemistry and Biology but have always shined best when allowed to be creative in school projects.
        A year into my graduate research journey at The Ohio State University's food science program,
        I decided that it wasn't for me and that I desired a career that better balanced creativity and problem-solving skills.
        Please follow me as I develop websites and myself.
